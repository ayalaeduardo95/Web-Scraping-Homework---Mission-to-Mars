# Web-Scraping-Homework---Mission-to-Mars

Hello, 

This homework was very challenging. I started it with a lot of time, but didn't manage it to complete it.

The Jupyter Notebook I think I did it well.

The only thing I didn't do was the part of Mars Weather as it wasn't required.

For the Flask Apliction, I managed for my Index.html to work.

Never the less I did the scrape part of the homework but couldn't run it into Mongo.

When I ran my Scrape.py in Git Bash nothing happened and I couldn't manage to fix the error in time.

So the problem with my homework is that I couldn't connect the data I scraped with the jupyter notebook or the Scrape application into my Flask and into my HTML.

Regards!
